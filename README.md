# Rust Agents
This is a very rough/prototype reimplementation of the basic HASH tutorial codes in rust.
The aim being to produce a framework that still allows composition components and actions
in a similar way to Hash Actions, while being type-safe and checked at compile time, and not
incurring the overhead of dynamic agents.

The two main exapmles that are copied are "Alice and Bob" and "Boids", and are found in the tests
subdirectory. In both cases the core exapmle of the functionality is in the "test_main" function.
